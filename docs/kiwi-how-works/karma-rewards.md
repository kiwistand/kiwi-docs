# Karma Rewards

Kiwi earns revenue whenever someone mints a <u>[Kiwi Pass](https://news.kiwistand.com/kiwipass-mint?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=karma_rewards)</u>

We take part of this revenue and automatically distribute it among the most active users. At this point, these users are 10 people who collected the most karma in the last 7 days.

### Sparks

The amount of ETH distributed to people is displayed on <u>[Community Page](https://news.kiwistand.com/community?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=karma_rewards)</u>

The symbol you can see next to people's names (✧) is Sparks. This is the name of a new unit of Ethereum, <u>[introduced by ZORA](https://zora.co/writings/sparks)</u>. 1 ETH = 1,000,000 ✧.

### How to get rewarded

The only way to get rewarded is to collect Karma. To do so, you need to post great links that get upvoted by other users. You can read more about <u>[Karma here](/docs/kiwi-how-works/karma)</u>.

### Why we're doing it

On web2 social networks, users generate the most value, but they don’t get (directly) paid.

On Kiwi, our community curates the feed. We observed that the better content we have, the more new users come, and we want to reward the community for their efforts. Even if the sums shared are (for now) symbolic.

We believe that in long-term it will results in a positive flywheel.
