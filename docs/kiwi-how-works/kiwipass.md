# Kiwipass NFT

Users mint <u>[Kiwi Pass NFT](https://news.kiwistand.com/kiwipass-mint?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=kiwipass)</u> when they sign up for our app. Signing up lets a user join our community and get the curator's supowerpowers (more on that in 'NFT utility' below).

### How the NFT works

Kiwi Pass NFT lets your wallet address interact with the <u>[Kiwi Protocol](/docs/kiwi-how-works/protocol)</u>. In other words, it lets you submit, upvote, and discuss links. It also gives you access to our closed Kiwipass holders' Telegram chat.

Each Kiwi Pass represents a Kiwi subscription - just like ENS NFT represents a subscription of an ENS domain. The difference is that Kiwi subscriptions - as of April 2024 - are perpetual, so you buy them once and use Kiwi forever. Kiwi Pass NFT is transferable, so you can buy a subscription and send it to your friend or sell it on OpenSea if you don't use the app anymore.

### NFT utility

The NFT provides 5 main utilities:

**1. Submitting links.**

You can share links you find interesting on our <u>[Submission page](https://news.kiwistand.com/submit?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=kiwipass)</u>. Your link will automatically land in the <u>[/New tab](https://news.kiwistand.com/new?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=kiwipass)</u>, and if it gets enough upvotes, it will move to the <u>[/Hot tab](https://news.kiwistand.com?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=kiwipass)</u>. Most popular links get featured by our <u>[Weekly Newsletter](https://paragraph.xyz/@kiwi-weekly)</u>, <u>[Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/kiwi)</u> and <u>[Twitter](https://twitter.com/KiwiNewsHQ)</u> bots.

For each upvote your link receives, you will get 1 <u>[Karma](/docs/kiwi-how-works/karma)</u> point. Before you submit a link, please check our <u>[Guidelines](https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines)</u> to ensure that it fits the vibe.

**2. Upvoting links.**

You can upvote links you find interesting. The more upvotes a link receives, the higher it will rank in the feed.

**3. Discussing links.**

You can also share your comments below the links. Our comment character limit is set at 10,000 characters, so you have plenty of space for nuanced conversation. You can also check the <u>[comment feed here](https://news.kiwistand.com/comments)</u>.

**4. Profile.**

Each of our NFT holders gets a profile that records their submissions and <u>[Karma score](/docs/kiwi-how-works/karma)</u>. We also add your description and links from ENS, and if you don't use ENS, we take them from Farcaster. Here's an exemplary profile from <u>[Tim Daub](https://news.kiwistand.com/timdaub.eth?utm_source=kiwi_docs&utm_medium=website_owned&utm_campaign=kiwipass)</u>.

**5. Access to the Telegram Channel.**

Kiwi community members get access to the holders-only Telegram channel. As of April 2024, there are over 300 members there, and we discuss our product ideas, interesting links, as well as crypto and life in general.
