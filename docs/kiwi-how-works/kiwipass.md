# Kiwipass NFT

To join the Kiwi Community, you need to own the Kiwipass NFT (you can <u>[mint it here](https://news.kiwistand.com/kiwipass-mint)</u>).

This NFT lets you submit, upvote, and discuss links. It also gives you access to our Kiwipass holders' Telegram chat.

### How the NFT works

Kiwipass NFT serves as an entrance ticket, that lets your wallet address interact with the <u>[Kiwi Protocol](/docs/kiwi-how-works/protocol)</u>. If a user builds their <u>[Karma score](/docs/kiwi-how-works/karma)</u>, the score is bound to their wallet address, not the NFT. This means that a user is free to sell their Kiwipass if they don't want to use it anymore.

### NFT utility

The NFT provides 5 main utilities:

**1. Submitting links.**

You can share links you find interesting on our <u>[Submission page](https://news.kiwistand.com/submit)</u>. Your link will automatically land in the <u>[/New tab](https://news.kiwistand.com/new)</u>, and if it gets enough upvotes, it will move to the <u>[/Hot tab](https://news.kiwistand.com)</u>.

For each upvote your link receives, you will get 1 Karma point. Before you submit a link, please check our <u>[Guidelines](https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines)</u> to ensure that it fits the vibe.

**2. Upvoting links.**

You can upvote links you find interesting. The more upvotes a link receives, the higher it will rank in the feed.

**3. Discussing links.**

You can also share your comments below the links. Our comment character limit is set at 10,000 characters, so you have plenty of space for nuanced conversation. You can also check the <u>[comment feed here](https://news.kiwistand.com/comments)</u>.

**4. Profile.**

Each of our NFT holders gets a profile that records their submissions. We also add your description and links from ENS, and if you don't use ENS, we take them from Farcaster. Here's an exemplary profile from <u>[Tim Daub](https://news.kiwistand.com/timdaub.eth)</u>.

**5. Access to the Telegram Channel.**

Kiwi community members get access to the holders-only Telegram channel. As of April 2024, there are over 300 members there, and we discuss our product ideas, interesting links, as well as crypto and life in general.
