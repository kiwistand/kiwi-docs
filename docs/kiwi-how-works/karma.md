# Karma

Each Kiwi user can collect Kiwi Karma. The Karma score is bound to users' wallet address, not the NFT. This means that if a user transfers their Kiwipass to another wallet, they still retain their Karma score.

### How users can receive Karma

There are two major ways to receive Kiwi Karma:

- submitting links (1 Kiwi karma point per link),

- receiving upvotes (1 Kiwi karma point per upvote received).

So if a user submits a link that gets 0 upvotes, they receive 1 karma point. If a user submits a link that gets 9 upvotes, they receive 10 karma points - 1 for submitting a link and 9 for upvotes.

You can check every user's Karma by clicking on their profile. You can find users' profiles in the <u>[Community section](https://news.kiwistand.com/community)</u>.

### What's the use case of Kiwi Karma

Karma has two major use cases:

- it defines the user's ranking in the Community section,

- it defines the voting power when distributing funds to the community during <u>[Kiwi Retroactive Funding](/docs/community/retro-funding)</u>.

We are considering adding other use cases, including putting Karma onchain.
