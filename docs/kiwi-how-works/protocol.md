# Protocol

Kiwi is powered by a P2P Protocol, similar to Farcaster.

Our architecture is much simpler, though.

When the user signs up, they mint a Kiwipass NFT (they can also buy it on a secondary market). After 1-5 minutes, our indexer adds their blockchain address to the allowlist. From now on, this address can interact with the protocol.

:::tip[Important]

As of April 2024, minting Kiwipass NFT is an "All you can eat" offer. This means that you pay once and can use Kiwi as much as you want.

How's it possible that there's no gas? Your actions, such as submissions, upvotes, and comments, aren't stored on a blockchain. They're stored on a P2P network, which makes them much cheaper to maintain.
