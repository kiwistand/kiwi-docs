# Who is Kiwi for

Being active on Kiwi is not for everyone. If you’re not deeply interested in Ethereum or only care about the latest 10X memecoin, then it’s probably not for you.

But if you deeply care about the ETH ecosystem, you can join the movement that creates a healthy, decentralized alternative for discovering high-signal Ethereum news, ideas, and products.

**When you become active on Kiwi, you can:**

* Shape the feed read by 1,500+ Ethereum power users, by submitting, upvoting and commenting on Kiwi links,
* Meet 500+ other smart Ethereum founders, devs, creators and investors,
* Get priority access to our IRL meetups, so far organized in Paris, Brussels, Warsaw, Berlin, Bangkok and Istanbul during major ETH conferences.

**We also organize extra perks for our active community members. So far these were:**
* Free Farcaster account *[October 2023]*
* 2X multiplier for the $DEGEN airdrop *[January -  May 2024]*
* Free Dappcon tickets *[May 2024]*
* 10% discount for the Devcon7 ticket *[July 2024-October 2024]*
