# Ads on Kiwi

Kiwi is a self-funded project, so to make it more sustainable, we decided to run community ads.

### **Who can you reach with the ads?**

There are about 1,500 people using the Kiwi app per month.

Most Kiwis are crypto natives - devs, founders, operators, creators & investors in Ethereum. They like to read long-form content and learn about new products. They use DeFi but are particularly excited about crypto beyond DeFi - social, infra, NFTs, art, and so on.

Plus, they’re real people, not bots.

### **How could you use our ads?**

Our ads offer more than just exposure - they position your brand as a supporter of Kiwi and its community.

Here's how they look:

#### What Kiwi ads are about:

- **Audience Fit**.

Kiwi helps you reach a niche audience that is hard to find anywhere else. If you think it’s better to reach 100 crypto natives than 10,000 bots, our ads might be good for you.

- **Building Brand Awareness**.

Even if someone doesn’t click on your ad, repeated exposure in the Kiwi feed can help build brand awareness over time.

- **Showcasing your support.**

By advertising with us, you signal that your brand is aligned with Kiwi’s OG crypto values. Our community sees you as contributing to our growth and mission. This alignment can build trust with potential customers who appreciate shared values.

### **How do the ads work?**

Our ad-buying model is based on a [smart contract.](https://github.com/attestate/ad)

**Here’s how it works:**

1. **Stake to Advertise**: To claim the ad space, you stake an amount of ETH. For example, if you stake 1 ETH, you secure the right to set the title and link of the ad.

2. **Collateral Deductions**: Your collateral is used to pay for ad space over time. If you stake 1 ETH, we’ll deduct 1 ETH/month in fees, with deductions happening every second.

   - **Day 0**: You’ve staked 1 ETH and can set your ad. To take over the ad space, a competitor would need to stake more than your 1 ETH, which you’d get back.
   - **Day 15**: Halfway through the month, your remaining collateral would be 0.5 ETH, so a competitor would only need to stake a little over 0.5 ETH to take over.
   - **Day 30**: By the end of the month, your collateral is nearly depleted, making it cheaper for others to buy the space from you.

3. **All fees support Kiwi**: As your ad runs, the fees are gradually transferred to the Kiwi treasury, directly supporting our operations.

**Superscan campaign case study:**

Superscan spent 5.59 USD on Kiwi ads on in August and September. They got 38 clicks in August, and 31 in September, 69 in total. That puts the CPC (Cost Per Click) at 0.08 USD.

All our clicks are unique devices (a proxy for "reach").

### **How do you post your ad?**

**1) Go to <u>[news.kiwistand.com/submit](https://news.kiwistand.com/submit)</u> and click “Submit story as an ad”**

![Submit ad](/img/ad_submit.png "submit ad")

**2) Then you’d be asked to put the amount of ETH you want to stake, to take over the ad space.**

**3) Once you send the collateral, you just click "Submit onchain ad".**

### **How to Maximize Your Ad’s Success**

We're committed to helping our ad buyers get the best results. Here are some ways we can collaborate:

- **Choosing the right format.**

Whether it’s sending traffic to a landing page or highlighting a blog post, we can help you choose the best format for your campaign.

- **Title Optimization**.

A compelling title can make a big difference in getting more clicks. We’ve seen thousands of titles on Kiwi and know what works, so we can help you refine the message for maximum impact.

- **Submitting from your ENS**

Ads submitted by an ENS name known in the community can have higher CTRs than anon wallet addresses. If you are recognized within the community, this can significantly boost engagement.
