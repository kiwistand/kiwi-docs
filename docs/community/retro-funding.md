# Retroactive Funding

Since the beginning, we have been running Kiwi RPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) rounds. This means that we share some % of our income with the community.

**So far, we have shared:**

- 1.71 ETH
- 2831 OP (still being shared on the rolling basis)

with our contributors, which is about $18,000 as of March 2024.

**We generate money primarily via:**

- Kiwipass sales,
- Grants (such as Purple, Warpcast & OP RetroPGF).

We generally only pay retroactively and only based on what our income during that time is.

### How to get paid

The best way to get paid is to do something of high impact for Kiwi. If you have any ideas, please reach out to us (@timdaub or @macbudkowski) on Telegram so we can tell you if it fits our plans. And when the next round comes (we do them every few months), engage with us and, e.g., write a proposal to get paid.

In the voting, our users get the voting power proportionate to their Kiwi Karma score.
