# What is Kiwi Retroactive Funding

Since the beginning, we have been running Kiwi RPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) rounds. This means that we share some % of our income with the community.

So far, we have shared:

- 1.71 ETH
- 2831 OP (still being shared on the rolling basis)

with our contributors, which is about $18,000 as of March 2024.

We generate money primarily via:

- Kiwipass sales,
- Grants (such as Purple, Warpcast & OP RetroPGF).

We generally only pay retroactively and only based on what our income during that time is.

How to get paid
The best way to get paid is to do something of high impact for Kiwi.

If you have any ideas, please reach out to us (@timdaub or @macbudkowski) on Telegram so we can tell you if it fits our plans.

And when the next round comes (we do them every few months), engage with us and, e.g., write a proposal to get paid.

In the voting, our users get the voting power proportionate to their Kiwi Karma score.
