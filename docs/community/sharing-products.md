# Sharing your product

Kiwi is being read by 1,000+ crypto devs, founders, investors and operators, so it's a good place to share your product. You might find new users, receive high-quality feedback, or get answers to complex, technical questions.

Here's how to do it.

## How to present your product on Kiwi

First of all, it’s important to understand the Kiwi culture.

The best way to do it is to read the <u>[submissions and commenting guidelines](https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines)</u>. You can also check what kind of <u>[links are the most popular](https://news.kiwistand.com/best)</u>.

Once you understand what Kiwi is about, there are 3 main ways to present your product.

#### 1. Sharing a link to the product.

**Example:** <u>[ENS Data](https://ensdata.net/)</u>

**When it works:** When your product is straightforward, and users don’t need any extra explanation to understand why they should use it.

#### 2) Sharing a blogpost about your product.

**Example:** <u>[Vocdoni](https://blog.vocdoni.io/anonymous-voting-token-based)</u>

**When it works:** When your product is more complex and users need to understand the tech under the hood, its unique set of features, or the non-obvious problem it’s solving.

#### 3) Sharing a story about your building journey.

**Example:** <u>[Pincaster](https://paragraph.xyz/@matallo/a-year-of-building-pincaster)</u>

**When it works:** If the story of your project is interesting or it helps to better understand the product.
