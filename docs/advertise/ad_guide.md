# Ads guide

Kiwi users are among the top 1% of longest attention span users in Ethereum - they like to read long-form content, have nuanced discussions, and learn about new products.

Here’s how to reach them.

### How to prepare a good Kiwi ad

0. #### The ad should feel like an organic Kiwi story.

One good example is this <u>[Stealth addresses blogpost](https://news.kiwistand.com/stories?index=0x6752ea5222682b825ff704376caea24f51d1b1081a094b074518c154b04ee32217621237&t=1733839846710)</u> that also shows how FluidKey works.

If you were unsure if your ad is a good fit you can read our <u>[content guidelines](https://news.kiwistand.com/guidelines)</u> or check the <u>[most popular stories of the month](https://news.kiwistand.com/best?period=month)</u>.

1. #### Assume that all Kiwi users are smart, curious people with long attention spans, and write a title that such a person would like to click.

<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Bad ad:</span>
“NFTizer: Next-gen NFT explorer, only today 20% off for Kiwi users”

<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>Good ad:</span>
“NFTizer: NFT explorer for professional traders”

2. #### Assume that Kiwi users know absolutely nothing about your app but are generally curious to learn more.

<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Bad ad:</span>
[Links to the AppStore/Barebones landing page]

<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>Good ad:</span>
[Links to the blog post about the product’s vision or educational landing page]

3. #### Assume that users are not actively looking for your product, and you have to convince them to try it (on the page you linked, not in the ad).

<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Bad ad:</span>
Shares only a high-level overview or very low-level tech spec of your product.

<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>Good ad:</span>
Shares a High/low-level overview of the product with an explanation of why users should try it.

### Kiwi ad checklist

_Check it before you submit your ad_

- [ ] Title is descriptive, not promotional
- [ ] Page linked in the ad is educational
- [ ] You explain to users why they should try your product
- [ ] Website renders an ogImage
- [ ] You submit the ad through the ENS name you use on Kiwi
